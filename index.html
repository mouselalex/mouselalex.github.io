		<h1>History*</h1>
		<p>Millard was laid out in 1870 by Ezra Millard, and named for him. A post office was established in Millard in 1873, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1967. The town was incorporated in 1885. After lengthy legal fights, the town of Millard was annexed by the city of Omaha in 1971. There also were attempts through both the state legislature and the court system to annex Millard into the Omaha Public Schools, but the Millard Public Schools remained an independent unit; although recently they have been included under the Taxing authority of the Learning Community to extend Omaha's tax base.</p>
